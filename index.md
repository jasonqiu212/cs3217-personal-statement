Jason Qiu, A0235206N

## About Me

Hi! I'm Jason, a Year 3 Computer Science major passionate about building apps that both look good and do good. I firmly believe in the power of technology to help others and solve real-world problems.

## Why do you want to take CS3217?

### Meet and Learn from Like-Minded Peers

From interning at the Computing for Voluntary Welfare Organisations (CVWO) to working on NUS's open-source projects under CS3281, one of my greatest takeaways from these experiences was the amazing people I met.
While working with them, I was constantly wowed by their creative and innovative ideas that I would not have come up by myself.
Their passion and diligence also inspired me to go further than what is required.
In CS3217, I hope to meet more like-minded individuals whom I can learn from and can push me to go beyond expectations.

### Strengthen My Technical Expertise

From CS3217, I hope to strengthen my skills in:

- Developing production-quality mobile apps (Something new for me!)
- Employing software engineering concepts in real-world projects
- Collaborating efficiently in a team-setting

### For the Fun of It!

> "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." - Steve Jobs

I love creating cool applications!
Despite the high workload, I believe I will have a lot of fun from the course content, assignments, and team projects.
As quoted from Steve Jobs, I also believe that's how great work is accomplished.

## Describe your background and explain why you will make a more deserving candidate than the other applicants.

### Full-Stack Development Experience

I previously interned at the Computing for Voluntary Welfare Organisations ([CVWO](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~vwo/projects/2022-lbsa.html)), where we maintain IT systems to help non-profit organizations on administrative tasks.
My responsibilities involved developing a PWA to automate activity booking at 10 elderly activity centres using React, Ionic, and Ruby on Rails.
I also coordinated with Care Corner Singapore to implement report generation features for their case management system with React and Ruby on Rails.

I also work as a maintainer for [TEAMMATES](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates), an open-source peer evaluation website under NUS-OSS built using Angular and Java.
I worked on enhancing web accessibility and resolving mobile-friendliness issues and migrating Apache Solr full-text search integration from Google Cloud Datastore to PostgreSQL.

Outside of school, I also work on several web-based projects. Feel free to check them out on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jasonqiu212)!

I believe my experiences in web development make me resourceful and versatile in building applications under CS3217.
While I have little exposure with mobile applications, I believe many of the software engineering practices and design principles I learned from doing web development are transferrable.

### Integration with Artificial Intelligence

I am highly interested in integrating AI into everyday software.
In my previous course on Machine Learning, I got the opportunity to create a model that identifies pneumonia from chest X-Ray images.
In Natural Language Processing, I developed a [recipe chatbot](https://github.com/jasonqiu212/cookbook) that can parse information and answer questions about a recipe.
Essentially, both courses showed me how human decisions can be reproduced with a machine.
I believe my interest and exposure to AI helps to open up countless possibilities on the apps my team can create in CS3217, potentially leading to new project ideas that harness the power of AI.

### Passion and Attitude to Learn

Lastly, I am confident in my ability to learn quickly and positive growth mindset.
For instance, when faced with a new problem or bug, beyond implementing a solution correctly, I actively seek to find the correct solution.
I like to treat each problem as an opportunity for growth and learning.

In CS3217, there are undoubtedly many problems that will stump me.
I seek to approach each of them with resilience, a positive attitude, and a commitment to continuous growth.
Ultimately, I believe I can learn a lot from this course.

## What is the coolest program that you have ever written? Explain (+ attach code snippet or screenshots).

One of the coolest programs I built is **BookTank**, a textbook trading application for my high school built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.
I came up with BookTank because of a problem at my school where students had trouble over buying and selling their used textbooks since it was difficult to find exactly who was selling what.
To create BookTank, I collected user requirements from the student body and led a team of 3 to design, develop, and publicize the application.
Currently, BookTank is recognized as the official school textbook trading app with over 500 users and 200 transactions, easing the lives of many incoming students.

Although creating BookTank is not as complex as other programs, BookTank remains as my coolest project because it cemented my identity as a programmer.
Creating BookTank showed me that I was able to realize my creative solutions to real-world problems through code.
It felt liberating to know that I had the power to give back to the community around me.
Building off this journey, I strive to create more solutions like BookTank to help the world we live in.
